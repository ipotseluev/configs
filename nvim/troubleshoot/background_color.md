**Problem** 
Background color in nvim differs from bg color of iterm2


**Solution (by ChatGPT)**

*Actually, step (1) made it work

If the background color discrepancy in Neovim persists and it's not related to tmux, the issue may stem from the configuration within Neovim itself or the way it interacts with iTerm2's settings. Let’s revisit and expand on the configurations to ensure consistent background color:

### Step 1: Ensure iTerm2 is Set Correctly
Make sure that iTerm2 is configured for true color and the background color settings are correctly set:

1. **Open iTerm2 Preferences**:
   - Command+, (comma)

2. **Navigate to Profiles → Colors**:
   - Check and adjust the background color to ensure it's set to your preference.
   - Verify that no transparency or blending settings might affect how colors are shown.

3. **Navigate to Profiles → Terminal**:
   - Ensure that **Report Terminal Type** is set to `xterm-256color`.

### Step 2: Re-Configure Neovim for True Color
Let’s ensure Neovim is properly set to utilize true colors:

1. **Edit Neovim Configuration** (`init.vim` or `init.lua`):
   ```bash
   nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
   ```

   Insert or verify these lines are in your configuration file:
   ```vim
   set termguicolors
   hi Normal ctermbg=NONE guibg=NONE
   ```

   This command sets the terminal GUI colors and attempts to clear any background setting by setting it to `NONE`.

2. **Save and Exit**:
   - For Vimscript, save and exit with `:wq`.

### Step 3: Check Neovim Color Scheme
Sometimes specific color schemes override general settings. Make sure your color scheme doesn’t force a background color:

1. **Within Neovim**, change to a default or simple color scheme temporarily:
   ```vim
   :colorscheme default
   ```

   If the background color issue resolves with the default scheme, the problem lies with your regular color scheme.

### Step 4: Adjust Color Scheme File
If the problem is with your color scheme, you might need to edit its file directly:

1. **Find your color scheme file**:
   Typically located in `~/.config/nvim/colors/` or within a plugin directory.

2. **Modify the background settings**:
   Look for lines like `hi Normal` and set `guibg=NONE` and `ctermbg=NONE`:
   ```vim
   hi Normal guibg=NONE ctermbg=NONE
   ```

3. **Reload the color scheme** or restart Neovim.

### Step 5: Eliminate Plugin Interference
If you're using any plugins that might affect colors (like `vim-airline` or theme plugins), temporarily disable them to see if they might be causing the issue.

### Step 6: Confirm Terminal Integration
Lastly, confirm that Neovim isn’t loaded with terminal-specific settings that may interfere:

1. **Check for terminal-specific configurations** in your `init.vim`:
   Search for any conditional logic that might apply settings only for iTerm2 or other terminals.

Following these steps should help in identifying and fixing the issue with background color discrepancies in Neovim when used within iTerm2. If the issue still persists, consider whether other global Vim or Neovim settings or environmental variables might be influencing the color settings.
